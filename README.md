# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is well-defined. V. Isualize gave Omar and myself a new assignment. By using our knowledge and skills from Python and Pandas, to summarize the Dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city-type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that helps finalizes the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results:

In the image above, shows a chart of the differences in the ride-sharing data amongst different city types.
##### Rural:
- Considering rural areas are not densely populated, it is not surprising that most civilians would have their own vehicle of transportation.
- Thus, total rides, drivers and fares are a lot less than other places. 
- As average ride and driver fares are extremely costly and there is no chance of a change in those rates in rural areas. 

##### Suburban:
- Suburban areas are residential zones along the outskirts of the city. Like rural communities, civilians would have their own vehicle of transportation. There are those within that group that prefers other types of transportations.
- The total of rides and drivers within the suburban communities spikes up by hundred, more than the rural communities. 
- And total fares goes up approximately $15,000 more than the total fares of the rural communities.
- As average ride and driver fares seems quite average, fares can fluctuate depending on how the market goes. 

##### Urban:
- Urban areas are city zones that are densely populated and fewer civilians owning their own vehicle of transportation.
- Thus, total rides, drivers and fares exceeds the most compared to other communities but the average fares of rides and drivers are devastatingly lower than other communities. 

##### Summary:

1. Resources are wasted within the rural communities and driver fares are way too high. Reduce the drivers fares by 28%, so that the fares will even out with the suburban drivers and that extra 28% goes to the urban drivers.
2. Average ride fares should be a flat rate of $30.00 for each ride, it would not affect much of the rural communities but will have a slight increase of fares among the urban communities. 
3. Since it is a ride-sharing company, offer discounts of 5% to 10% for having more riders in a vehicle. Thus increasing sales and better advertisment approach to the communites all around.
